## About Me

I'm a Senior Analytical Manager with a passion for data visualisation techniques, process mining healthcare data & telling stories with data. I love to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

My career is mainly in Acute Hospitals where I've managed analytical teams, however over the last few years I've been working in NHS England within the East of England Region. I enjoy coaching people & supporting other analysts in problem solving.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning Python, R & Databricks. I'm also studying on a Data Analytics MsC with BPP University.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any NHS England regional projects which could support a reduction in duplication, automated reporting utilising the tools i'm currently learning & all areas of elective NHS data.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any articles linked to machine learning, data science & databricks.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about SQL, process mining or ideas on visualising data and framing analytical problems.
