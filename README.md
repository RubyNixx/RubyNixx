# Hi there, I'm Ruby ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a Senior Analytical Manager with a passion for data visualisation techniques, process mining healthcare data & telling stories with data. I love to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

My career is mainly in Acute Hospitals where I've managed analytical teams, however over the last few years I've been working in NHS England within the East of England Region. I enjoy coaching people & supporting other analysts in problem solving & upskilling in technical skills.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on automating all reporting in my role; mainly RTT, Outpatients & Inpatients, using databricks + python. If there's something that can be done better and more efficiently, I want to hear about it.
- ðŸŒ± Always learning Python & Databricks or struggling to debug some R code. I'm also studying on a Data Analytics MsC with BPP University.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any NHS England regional projects which could support a reduction in duplication, automated reporting utilising the tools i'm currently learning & all areas of elective NHS data.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with any articles linked to machine learning, data science & databricks.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about SQL, coding in pyspark/databricks/python/colab, process mining or ideas on visualising data and framing analytical problems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: If you would like to connect professionally, you can contact me either on ruby.nicholls@nhs.net or my linkedin page.
- âš¡ Fun fact: When i'm coding my go-to music choices are usually either metalcore or indie dreampop - have a look at my spotify analysis!

## Skills

- **Programming Languages**: Python :snake: & T-SQL. Sometimes I dabble in R if needed, but it's not my preferred language.
- **Big Data & Analytics Frameworks:** PySpark, Spark SQL
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Cloud & Development Platforms:** Databricks, Azure
- **Databases**: Microsoft SQL Server

## Projects

### Process Mining
- **Description**: Utilising healthcare data for process mining using open source languages. Currently have a R template, building a python template.
- **Technologies Used**: R, Python
- **Link**: [Process Mining R code with sample dataset](https://github.com/RubyNixx/Process_Mining_R_Healthcare) and [Process Mining Python Notebook with sample dataset](https://github.com/RubyNixx/Process_Mining_Python_Healthcare)

### Data Analytics MsC
- **Description**: Currently undertaking a masters in Data Analytics with projects in programming. Most recent project was to build a a regression model and time series analysis on a chosen dataset; I chose A&E Attendances which is published data. Previous assignments have included prediction of churn of customers in a fictional company. I've included both notebooks below. I achieved a distinction in both of these pieces of work, but scored a high distinction in the Time Series Analysis & Regression Modelling. I feel that my coding had improved quite alot by this submission which helped. I received good feedback on using a challenging dataset, clear presentation, well motivated & confident use of appropriate visualisation techniques, accompanied by excellent explanations from the meaning of the colour coding to the relevance of shaded areas in the autocorrelation plots.

- **Technologies Used**: Python
- **Link**:

- [A&E Time Series Analysis and Regression](https://github.com/RubyNixx/Time_Series_And_Regression)
Mark: 80/100 - Distinction

- [Telecomm Churn Analysis](https://github.com/RubyNixx/BPP_Telecomm_Churn)
Mark: 70/100 - Distinction

### Spotipy API
- **Description**: Using the spotipy API to visualise my listening habits on Spotify.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Google Colab
- **Link**: [Spotify analysis using spotipy](https://github.com/RubyNixx/spotify_analysis_using_spotipy)

## Coding Cheat Sheets & Useful Stuff
-**Description**: Pulls together useful resources on the coding languages i use. Feel free to suggest anything not listed or share your own.

See people I follow or repositories I've starred. Repo's worth a special mention below:

### Forecasting by Paul Carroll
-**Description**: Pulls together different methods of forecasting, with easy to follow plain english descriptions. I used this alot for time series forecasting as a reference point. Each methods subfolder has great instructions to follow with code.
